# Coding-Portfolio

### Description
This repository contains my Portfolio for my Creative Coding Course. Four projects were chosen from throughout the semester and improved upon. These projects include: the bot, novel, clock and screensaver projects


### Updates
##### Clock Project
In this improved version of the clock project, I started off by swapping out the two planets (symbolizing the hour hand and the center it orbits around), UFO (symbolizing the minute hand) for clipart images. This made it look a lot cleaner and nicer. Lastly, I changed the color of the alien that symbolized the seconds to match its UFO.
